💡 Learning Journey
During my time at Samz Technologies, I gained hands-on experience and learned best practices in web development. The course provided a deep dive into both front-end and back-end technologies, and I’m proud of the progress I've made so far.

The Airline Website project represents a culmination of all the skills and techniques I’ve acquired, and I’m excited to continue improving and building more complex applications in the future!
